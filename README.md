# MyTube

This repository is a portfolio project to exercise and demonstrate full-stack
development skills. The goal is to faithfully recreate [https://youtube.com],
using mock data.

I have strived to make the git log an informative record of development effort.
You can consult it to track my progress and understand my thought process.

## Usage

To run the project, first install deno.

Then, in the root of the project, run:

```
deno task start
```
